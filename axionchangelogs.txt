# AXION 1.3 (12/04/'25)
- Drop EUICC Changes (Cause its broken)
- Fixed IR Sensor
- Fixed Doze Brightness
- Set animations to 0.8x by default
- Allow games to use 120fps
- Define Correct CPU variant

This will allow the system to make better optimizations for performance and power efficiency

 * We are using generic for major work of the cpu but enforce to use preferencially cortex-a76 for their optimizations
TARGET_CPU_VARIANT := generic: This setting tells the system to use general optimizations for any CPU type, without targeting Cortex-A78 specific features.
TARGET_CPU_VARIANT_RUNTIME := cortex-a76: Here you are telling the system that even if it uses general optimizations, it should assume that it is running on a Cortex-A76 processor during OS execution.
This is the closest you can get to taking advantage of A76 features on an A78, as AOSP does not have direct support for the A78.

The current setting is the most recommended for your Cortex-A78 device, as it gives you a good balance between optimizations and compatibility.
By using generic for the TARGET_CPU_VARIANT and cortex-a76 for the TARGET_CPU_VARIANT_RUNTIME, you are taking full advantage of your processor's capabilities without taking unnecessary risks.
Since aosp does not support Cortex-a78 the closest is cortex-a76.

* Using cortex-a55 for 2nd cpu clusters
By specifying cortex-a55 for both TARGET_2ND_CPU_VARIANT and TARGET_2ND_CPU_VARIANT_RUNTIME, we are providing the system with accurate information about the hardware in the second cluster.
This will allow the system to perform specific optimizations for these cores, thus improving performance and power efficiency.

Reason No.2 :
[amritokun]
As mentioned in the above text AOSP has no direct support for the Cortex-A78 & SM6375 (SD695) has two big clusters locked at 2.21 GHz based on Cortex-A78
As Per previous configuration by @dereference23 , He mentioned in 38dd683 commit
both were set to Cortex-A55 even the big ones .
This was hurting CPU performence & optimisation considerebly
